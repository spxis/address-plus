// Builds the Australian and British tables in src/constants/au/ and src/constants/gb/ from three open sources:
//
//   - kuni (@johnmorrisdotca/kuni, MIT, a devDependency only): the states and territories of Australia and the four
//     nations of the United Kingdom, with their ISO 3166-2 codes and their names in English and Japanese. The few
//     rows needed are copied here, so kuni is never a dependency of the package.
//   - The Australian Bureau of Statistics' allocation of mesh blocks to Postal Areas, ASGS Edition 3 (July 2021 to
//     June 2026), POA_2021_AUST.xlsx, CC BY 4.0: which states each postcode's area lies in, so the postcodes that
//     cross a state border are known rather than guessed. A mesh block's code begins with its state's code.
//   - Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open, Open Government Licence v3.0: every postcode in Great Britain with the nation
//     it lies in, read down to the postcode districts each area has and the nations each district lies in.
//     Northern Ireland (BT) is not in it, and is not taken from anywhere else: the ONS Postcode Directory carries it,
//     but its Northern Ireland postcodes need a licence from Land & Property Services for commercial use.
//
//   - La Poste's Base officielle des codes postaux (Licence Ouverte 2.0), every postcode of France, the overseas
//     departments and collectivities and Monaco, and INSEE's Code officiel géographique (Licence Ouverte 2.0): the
//     departments, their regions and the overseas collectivities, with their names. France's tables hold which
//     postcodes exist and which department or territory each belongs to, not the communes.
//
// Run: node scripts/countries/update-country-data.ts [--only au,gb,fr] [--abs <POA_2021_AUST.xlsx>]
//   [--codepoint <codepo_gb folder>] [--laposte <hexasmal.csv>] [--insee <folder of v_departement_2026.csv,
//   v_region_2026.csv and v_comer_2026.csv>]
// Without arguments it downloads everything it needs (about 37 MB) into a temporary folder; `--only fr` makes France's
// tables alone (about 1.6 MB). It needs `unzip` for Australia and Great Britain. Node 24 runs it as is.
