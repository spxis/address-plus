# Development Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for development, debugging, and maintenance.

## Australian and British Tables

`countries/update-country-data.ts` (`pnpm data:countries`) writes the `*.data.ts` files under `src/constants/au/` and
`src/constants/gb/`: the Australian states and the British nations copied from kuni (a devDependency), the Australian
postcodes that cross a state border from the ABS's Postal Areas allocation file (CC BY 4.0), and the British postcode
districts and their nations from Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open (OGL v3). Without arguments it downloads both
inputs (about 35 MB); `--abs <POA_2021_AUST.xlsx>` and `--codepoint <folder>` read copies already on disk. It needs
`unzip`. `docs/COUNTRIES.md` lists every source and its licence.

## Sub-regions Data Pipeline

The `sub-regions/` directory contains a modular TypeScript pipeline for automatically fetching, normalizing, and merging authoritative sub-region data for both the United States and Canada.

### Overview

The pipeline consists of three main scripts:

1. **`fetch-us-sub-regions.ts`** - Queries the US Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Places API
2. **`fetch-ca-sub-regions.ts`** - Pulls from Statistics Canada's Standard Geographical Classification dataset
3. **`update-sub-regions.ts`** - Orchestrates both fetchers, normalizes, deduplicates, and generates output

### Usage

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
pnpm data:sub-regions
```

### What it does

- **Fetches comprehensive data**: Collects boroughs, parishes, districts, quadrants, and other administrative subdivisions
- **Handles bilingual names**: Processes both English and French names for Canadian sub-regions
- **Validates and deduplicates**: Ensures data quality and removes duplicates with intelligent priority rules
- **Generates optimized output**: Creates TypeScript files with lookup maps and filtered collections for performance
- **Provides statistics**: Reports on data coverage and type distribution

### Output

The pipeline generates `src/constants/sub-regions.ts`, which is never edited by hand, containing:

- `ALL_SUB_REGIONS` - Complete array of all sub-regions
- `SUB_REGION_NAMES` - Set for fast lookup
- `SUB_REGION_MAP` - Map for detailed lookup
- Country-specific collections (`US_SUB_REGIONS`, `CA_SUB_REGIONS`)
- Type-specific collections (`BOROUGHS`, `PARISHES`, `DISTRICTS`, etc.)

### Data Sources

**US Data:**

- US Census Bureau TIGER/Line Places API
- Covers all 50 states plus DC and territories
- Includes incorporated places and census designated places
- Rate-limited to be respectful to the API

**Canadian Data:**

- Statistics Canada Standard Geographical Classification (primary)
- Hardcoded fallback for major metropolitan areas
- Handles bilingual names and special cases like Montreal arrondissements

### Features

- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks and detailed logging
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful API usage with configurable delays
- **Type detection**: Smart pattern matching for administrative types
- **Parent city mapping**: Links sub-regions to major metropolitan areas
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data quality checks
- **ES module compatible**: Uses modern JavaScript standards

### Maintenance

The pipeline should be run periodically to keep sub-region data current:

- **Monthly**: For active development
- **Quarterly**: For stable releases
- **After major census updates**: When new official data is released

### Dependencies

- Node's built-in `fetch` for the HTTP requests to the data APIs, so there is no HTTP dependency
- `pnpm data:sub-regions` runs the TypeScript directly with `node` (Node 24 strips the types), which is why the scripts import each other with the `.ts` extension

## Japanese data

`pnpm data:jp` regenerates the Japanese prefecture, municipality and postal-prefix tables (`src/constants/jp/*.data.ts`) with `scripts/jp/update-jp-data.ts`. Those files are generated and never edited by hand.

## Package and release scripts

- **check-package.mjs** (`pnpm test:package`) - After `pnpm build`, packs the package, installs the tarball in a temporary project and proves that `require`, `import` and the types work for both entry points, and that the `/jp` bundle carries no US street-type tables
- **release.mjs** (`pnpm release <version>`) - Sets the version, moves the changelog's Unreleased entries under it, commits and tags; `node scripts/release.mjs --notes <version>` prints a version's changelog section. Its tests are in **release.test.mjs**

## Other Development Scripts

## Files

- **analyze-json-failures.js** - Analyzes test failures in JSON test data files
- **debug-directional.js** - Debug script for directional address parsing issues
- **debug-patterns.js** - Debug script for address pattern parsing

## Usage

Most scripts can be run directly with Node.js:

```bash
# Analyze test failures
node scripts/analyze-json-failures.js

# Debug directional patterns
node scripts/debug-directional.js

# Debug general patterns
node scripts/debug-patterns.js
```

Note: Some scripts may require the project to be built first (`pnpm build`).
