// Codes reported:
//   INVALID_POSTAL_FORMAT     the postcode is not five digits
//   UNRECOGNIZED_POSTAL_CODE  GeoNames' list for Germany does not have it
//   MISSING_POSTAL_CODE       no postcode is given (a Postfach has the postcode of its own)
//   MISSING_CITY              no place is given
//   MISSING_STREET_NUMBER     a street with no house number (a street alone, a Postfach and a Packstation excepted)
// The postcode findings are warnings, and errors with strictPostalValidation; the others are warnings.

/**
 * Checks an address in Germany against Deutsche Post's postcode shape and GeoNames' list: the postcode is five digits and
 * the list has it, and the place and the house number are given. The list is GeoNames' and not Deutsche Post's, so a
 * postcode made since it was copied is flagged as unrecognised.
 *
 * @param address - The address as `parseGermanAddress` (or `parseLocation` with the module) returns it.
 * @param options - `strictPostalValidation: true` makes the postcode findings errors; the rest are not used.
 * @returns The errors and warnings, each with its field, code and message.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * validateGermanAddress(parseGermanAddress("Hauptstraße 12, 00000 Berlin")).warnings.map((one) => one.code)
 * // → ["UNRECOGNIZED_POSTAL_CODE"]
 * ```
