// What can be checked about an Australian address from the tables alone: the postcode's shape, whether a state's
// block holds it, and whether that is the state named. A postcode that crosses a border passes with any state it
// serves, and the external territories' postcodes are not judged against a state.
//
// Codes reported:
//   INVALID_POSTAL_FORMAT     the postcode is not four digits
//   UNRECOGNIZED_POSTAL_CODE  no state's block of postcodes holds it
//   POSTAL_REGION_MISMATCH    the postcode belongs to another state than the one named
//   MISSING_STATE             no state or territory is given
//   MISSING_POSTAL_CODE       no postcode is given
//   MISSING_CITY              no suburb or town is given
// The postal findings are warnings, and errors with strictPostalValidation, as for the US, Canada and Japan.

/**
 * Checks an Australian address against Australia Post's blocks of postcodes: the postcode is four digits, some
 * state's block holds it, and it is the state named, or one it serves across a border (from the ABS's Postal Areas).
 * Also warns when the state, the postcode or the suburb is missing.
 *
 * @param address - The address as `parseAustralianAddress` (or `parseLocation` with the module) returns it.
 * @param options - `strictPostalValidation: true` makes the postcode findings errors; the rest are not used.
 * @returns The errors and warnings, each with its field, code and message.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * validateAustralianAddress(parseAustralianAddress("1 Main St, Sydney VIC 2000")).warnings[0].message
 * // → "Postcode 2000 belongs to NSW, not VIC"
 * ```
