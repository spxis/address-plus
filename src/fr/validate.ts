//   INVALID_POSTAL_FORMAT     the postcode is not five digits

//   OUTSIDE_FRANCE            its number is Monaco's or an overseas collectivity's, which have country codes of their own
//   MISSING_POSTAL_CODE       no postcode is given
//   MISSING_CITY              no commune is given
// A postcode with a CEDEX is not looked for in La Poste's base, which lists communes' postcodes and not CEDEX codes.
// The postcode findings are warnings, and errors with strictPostalValidation; OUTSIDE_FRANCE is always a warning.

/**
 * Checks an address in France against La Poste's postcode shape and the tables: the postcode is five digits, its
 * number names a department, a collectivity or Monaco, and La Poste's base officielle lists it. Says when a postcode
 * is Monaco's or an overseas collectivity's, which have country codes of their own, and warns when the postcode or the
 * commune is missing.
 *
 * @param address - The address as `parseFrenchAddress` (or `parseLocation` with the module) returns it.
 * @param options - `strictPostalValidation: true` makes the postcode findings errors; the rest are not used.
 * @returns The errors and warnings, each with its field, code and message.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * validateFrenchAddress(parseFrenchAddress("12 rue de la Paix, 75099 Paris")).warnings.map((one) => one.code)
 * // → ["UNRECOGNIZED_POSTAL_CODE"]
 * ```
