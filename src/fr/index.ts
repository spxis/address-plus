/**
 * France's module, for `parseLocation` and `validateAddress`: pass it in `countries`, and an address that ends with
 * France (or Monaco or an overseas territory), holds CEDEX, or has a French type of voie and a postcode first on its
 * last line is read as French; `country: "FR"` reads any address as one, and so does the code of an overseas department
 * or collectivity. It reads Monaco (`MC`) and the collectivities (`PM`, `BL`, `MF`, `WF`, `PF`, `NC`) too, and reports
 * their own codes.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * parseLocation("12 bis rue de la Paix, 75002 Paris, France", { countries: [france] })?.numberExtension
 * // → "bis"
 * ```
