// Parsed address result with all possible fields. A Japanese address fills its own fields (prefecture,
// municipality, town, chome, ban, go, building, floor, room) and the shared ones that stand for them:
// state holds the prefecture's JIS code, city the municipality, street the town, number the block. An
// Australian, British, French or German address, read by its country's module, adds the few fields of its own.

/**
 * What `parseLocation` returns: every part it found, each absent when the address has none. A Japanese address fills
 * its own fields and the shared ones that stand for them: `state` the prefecture's JIS code, `city` the municipality,
 * `street` the town, `number` the block, `zip` the postal code.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * parseLocation("123 Main St Apt 4, Anytown, NY 12345")
 * // → {"number":"123","secUnitType":"Apartment","secUnitNum":"4","unit":"Apt 4","street":"Main","type":"St","city":"Anytown","state":"NY","zip":"12345","zipValid":true,"country":"US"}
 * ```
