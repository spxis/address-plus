// Royal Mail uses its area, and, in Great Britain, whether Code-Point Open lists its district. Northern Ireland's
// districts are not in the open data, so a BT postcode is checked only to its area.
//
// Codes reported:
//   INVALID_POSTAL_FORMAT     the postcode does not follow Royal Mail's grammar
//   UNRECOGNIZED_POSTAL_CODE  its area is not one Royal Mail uses, or its district is not in Code-Point Open
//   OUTSIDE_UK                its area is Jersey's, Guernsey's or the Isle of Man's, which are not in the UK
//   MISSING_POSTAL_CODE       no postcode (and no BFPO number) is given
//   MISSING_CITY              no post town is given
// The postcode findings are warnings, and errors with strictPostalValidation; OUTSIDE_UK is always a warning.

/**
 * Checks an address in the United Kingdom against Royal Mail's postcode grammar and the tables: the postcode is well
 * formed, Royal Mail uses its area, and in Great Britain Code-Point Open lists its district. Says when a postcode is
 * Jersey's, Guernsey's or the Isle of Man's, which are not part of the UK, and warns when the postcode or the post
 * town is missing.
 *
 * @param address - The address as `parseUKAddress` (or `parseLocation` with the module) returns it.
 * @param options - `strictPostalValidation: true` makes the postcode findings errors; the rest are not used.
 * @returns The errors and warnings, each with its field, code and message.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * validateUKAddress(parseUKAddress("1 High Street, London EC9Z 1AA")).warnings.map((one) => one.code)
 * // → ["INVALID_POSTAL_FORMAT"]
 * ```
