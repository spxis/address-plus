 * The United Kingdom's module, for `parseLocation` and `validateAddress`: pass it in `countries`, and an address with a
 * British postcode (or ending with the United Kingdom or a nation) is read as British; `country: "GB"` reads any
 * address as one. It reads Jersey (`JE`), Guernsey (`GY`) and the Isle of Man (`IM`) too.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * parseLocation("221B Baker Street, London NW1 6XE", { countries: [unitedKingdom] })?.number
 * // → "221B"
