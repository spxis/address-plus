# address-plus

`@johnmorrisdotca/address-plus` parses US, Canadian and Japanese addresses, and Australian, French, German and British ones through their country modules. The coding conventions are in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md); this file covers the toolchain, the layout and the release procedure.

## Toolchain

- Node 24 (`.nvmrc`, `engines`) and pnpm 10 (`packageManager`). Always `pnpm`, never npm or yarn.
- TypeScript 5.9, built with tsup 8.5 to ESM and CommonJS with type declarations in `dist/`.
- Vitest 5 for unit tests, `tsd` for the published type definitions.
- ESLint 9 with the flat config in `eslint.config.js` (typescript-eslint's recommended rules), and Prettier with `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`). Prettier orders the imports; ESLint does not.
- Style: double quotes, 120 columns, 2 spaces, `//` comments that say why, no emoji anywhere, exports gathered at the end of a file. A name starting with `_` may be unused.
- Every public export has a TSDoc block (`/** */`) with a summary, `@param`, `@returns` and an `@example` ending in `// → <answer>`; `pnpm docs:check` holds each answer to the built package and checks the blocks reach `dist/*.d.ts`. The API reference (`docs/api.md`, `api.html`) is made from them.

## Commands

| Command                  | What it does                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm check`             | Everything CI runs, in this order: lint, typecheck, test, build, docs:check, test:types, schema:validate, test:package |
| `pnpm lint`              | ESLint, then `prettier --check .`; `pnpm lint:fix` fixes what it can                                       |
| `pnpm typecheck`         | `tsc -p tsconfig.check.json`: `src/**` including the tests, and `scripts/**/*.ts`                          |
| `pnpm test`              | Vitest, once (`pnpm test:watch` to watch, `pnpm test:coverage` for coverage)                               |
| `pnpm build`             | tsup into `dist/`: `dist/index.*`, `dist/jp/index.*`, `dist/au/index.*`, `dist/de/index.*`, `dist/fr/index.*` and `dist/gb/index.*`              |
| `pnpm test:types`        | `tsd` on `src/__tests__/types.test-d.ts`; needs `dist/index.d.ts`, so build first                          |
| `pnpm schema:validate`   | Validates every JSON file in `test-data/` against the schemas in `schemas/`                                |
| `pnpm test:package`      | `scripts/check-package.mjs`; packs the built package and proves it works as a user installs it             |
| `pnpm docs:check`        | `scripts/check-docs.mjs`: every export has TSDoc and an example whose answer the built package gives; needs `dist/` |
| `pnpm docs:make`         | Writes `docs/api.md`, the API reference, from the TSDoc                                                    |
| `pnpm data:jp`           | Regenerates the Japanese data tables (documented in `scripts/README.md`)                                   |
| `pnpm data:sub-regions`  | Regenerates `src/constants/sub-regions.ts` from the Census and Statistics Canada                           |
| `pnpm data:countries`    | Regenerates the Australian, British, French and German tables from kuni, the ABS, Code-Point Open, La Poste, INSEE and GeoNames (`docs/COUNTRIES.md`) |
| `pnpm release <version>` | Cuts a release (below)                                                                                     |

Run `pnpm check` before every push. It must pass with nothing disabled: do not turn a lint rule off to get green unless the rule is wrong for this repository, and then say why in the commit.

## Layout

- Six entry points, all built by tsup: `src/index.ts` is the package root, `src/jp/index.ts` is `@johnmorrisdotca/address-plus/jp`, and `src/au/index.ts`, `src/de/index.ts`, `src/fr/index.ts` and `src/gb/index.ts` are the country modules `/au`, `/de`, `/fr` and `/gb`. The `/jp` bundle must not carry the US street-type tables, and `/au`, `/de`, `/fr` and `/gb` must carry none of the US, Canadian or Japanese tables nor each other's; `pnpm test:package` fails if they do. Keep those modules from importing anything that pulls in another country's tables. The main entry point never imports a country module: it takes them in the `countries` option (`src/country/pick.ts`). `docs/COUNTRIES.md` says how to add a country.
- `src/parser.ts` and `src/parsers/` parse; `src/constants/` holds the tables; `src/patterns/` holds every regular expression; `src/utils/` holds shared helpers; `src/types/` holds the types.
- Tests are in `src/__tests__/`. Their data is JSON in `test-data/`, one folder per area, validated against `schemas/`. Test-only scripts live in `scripts/*.test.mjs`.
- `scripts/*.js` (the old debug scripts) are not linted; leave them alone.

## Generated data

Files named `*.data.ts` (the Japanese prefectures, municipalities and postal prefixes under `src/constants/jp/`) are written by `pnpm data:jp`, those under `src/constants/au/`, `src/constants/de/`, `src/constants/fr/` and `src/constants/gb/` by `pnpm data:countries`, and `src/constants/sub-regions.ts` is written by `pnpm data:sub-regions`. Never edit them by hand: change the generator in `scripts/` and run it again. Prettier ignores `*.data.ts`, so the generator's output does not have to be formatted.

## Release procedure

1. Add each change under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` as it lands, in Keep a Changelog style (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`).
2. From a clean `main`, run `pnpm release <version>` (for example `pnpm release 1.2.0`). It refuses a dirty tree, a branch other than `main`, an empty Unreleased section, and a version that is not greater than the current one. Otherwise it sets the version in `package.json`, moves the Unreleased entries under `## <version> - <today>`, commits `chore(release): <version>`, and tags `v<version>`. It pushes nothing.
3. Push the commit and the tag: `git push origin main` then `git push origin v<version>`.
4. The tag starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which verifies the tag against `package.json` and the changelog, reruns `pnpm check` (the `ci.yml` workflow), publishes to npm with provenance, and creates the GitHub release with the changelog section as its notes. The npm step publishes with trusted publishing, so there is no token: the package's Trusted Publisher setting on npmjs.com names the `johnmorrisdotca` organization or user, the `address-plus` repository and the `release.yml` workflow filename, with no environment.

Never change the version by hand, and never publish from a laptop: the tag does it.
